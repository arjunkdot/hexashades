If you find a bug in the project, please help by reporting it:

1. Check the issue tracker to see if the bug has already been reported.

I appreciate your contributions! To submit a pull request (PR), follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2. Write clear, concise commit messages that explain your changes.

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use a short, descriptive message (50 characters or less).
- If the change is related to an issue, reference the issue number using #.
